# Team-Profile-Generator

# Summary:
For this assignment, we were asked to create a team profile generator that helps the user to create a team that includes a manager and as many engineers or interns needed. This app was to be used on the command line in order to create the HTML document with each person on the team. 


# Getting Started:
Before starting this assignment, I thought it seemed very similar to our last assignment which was the ReadMe Generator, both projects were to be used on the command line and the end result was to generate a document with the required information, so I started to create a prompt of questions that will generate an HTML document similar to the ReadMe Generator. 

I think I spend about 80% of the time trying to figure out how to create the prompts to generate each type of employee and then at the end put everything together to generate one HTML file. Some of the questions I had were: 
* Should I create HTML files for each type of employee? 
* Should I create individual JavaScript files for each employee and then somehow link them together?
* Should I create one single prompt of questions and then figure out how to generate each type of employee individually?

A lot of questions but no answers, I probably spend way too much time doing research as well as experimenting with code to get much done. What I wanted to focus on, was trying to figure out how to even get started without creating a mess that would take me ages to fix later. 
If this project is "simmilar" to the ReadMe Generator, then I decided to start the same way I did with that, creating a prompt full of questions and then going from there. 

There was a lot of trial and error in this assignment, I probably redid the code about 3 times before I got stuck with what you see now. Some of the trials that I did were:

* Creating individual HTML files as well as JS files, then attempting to put them together in one JS file to create a prompt of questions, which didnt work. 

* Using the code from my last HW assignment and using it as a reference which then I would go back and edit so that the prompt of questions would generate a section for each type of employee.



# Final Thoughts and Improvments: 
I am aware that I did not complete assignment due to the lack in the following:
*  In the command prompt, there isnt an option that allows the user to choose what kind of employee they would like to add to the team.

Because I got stuck so much, now I know what works and what doesnt, being able to generate a prompt that allows the user to chose an employee to add to the team will obviously be my main task to complete/fix for the future.
